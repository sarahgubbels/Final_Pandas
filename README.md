Overall, the scores in the Charter schools do appear to be performing better than the schools within the districts. The Charter schools with an overall passing rate of 90% compared to 54%. There is also evidence the schools that are less populated also had an average higher score for math and reading, along with the overall percentage. The spending was also evaluated and there does not seem to be a correlation between the size, budget, or overall scores for schools or students. 
My conclusion of the data is the smaller the schools and Charter schools have a much better outcome for students who are looking to excel in math and or reading.
